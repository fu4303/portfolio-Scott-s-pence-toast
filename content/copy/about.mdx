</Small>

I'm a web developer for Creative Products at [Karmarama], based in
Farringdon, London UK. Currently working from home.

From the 26th of April 2021 I will be working with GraphCMS as a
Developer Advocate.

I create content written in the blog here and also in educational
videos supporting the written content.

I'm a second career dev, that reskilled from a VBA analyst developer
role into web development.

I'm a massive fan of the [Jamstack] I have a wealth of knowledge
working with [Gatsby].

More details in the [portfolio section].

### Sectors I have worked in:

I have over ten years experience in working for large corporate
organisations in Finance (Risk, Asset Management), Property, Oil & Gas
and Lloyd's insurance market.

As a web developer I've worked in government digital transformation
and creative digital.

### My personality

I find it hard to identify my traits, so instead I took the
[16Personalities] test, here are [my results].

## My interests

Since COVID hit we've all been housebound for well over a year now. I
like to go running daily or every other day.

I'm obsessed with watching anything to do with mechanical engineering.

I play Borderlands 3 on Stadia, then Borderlands 1 and 2 on the
Nintendo Switch.

### Music I listen to

I'm a massive Drum and Bass fan, I have a Spotify playlist I like to
listen to for coding with the title for which I stole from Phil
Hawksworth:

<Spotify
  spotifyLink="playlist/4etN3fawLp5rWiAFdJZQp5?si=bWljWzzsTq2kFj6hq5f-lQ"
  width="100%"
/>

Other playlists I'd recommend would be the UKF Drum and Bass Top 100:

<Spotify
  spotifyLink="playlist/0Zarq4BVkFkZOWkmqsfrjA?si=x3WLxJnVS12NVWWDt1LUXg"
  width="100%"

### Podcasts I listen to

I listen to many podcasts, here are some that I get a lot of value
from that aren't all code related:
