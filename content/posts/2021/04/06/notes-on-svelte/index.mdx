I had a play around with Svelte the other day and wanted to make a few
notes and comparisons to React, React being a point of reference for
me and hopefully others,

A simple Svelte app could look something like this:

```html
<!-- Simple component -->
<!-- Circle.svelte -->
<style>
  div {
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    margin: 20px;
    font-size: 2rem;
    background-color: #663399;
    color: #fff;
    border-radius: 9999px;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
  }
</style>

<script>
  export let text = 'hello world'
</script>

<div>{text}</div>
```

Then that can be used by `App.svelte` say:

```html
<!-- App.svelte -->
<script>
  import Circle from './Circle.svelte'
</script>

<main>
  <Circle />
</main>
```

In the component I defined the prop with `export let text` which is
defaulted to `hello world` but I can pass in my own prop to the
`Circle` component to replace it!

```html
<!-- App.svelte -->
<script>
  import Circle from './Circle.svelte'
</script>

<main>
  <Circle text="wheeeeee" />
</main>
```
