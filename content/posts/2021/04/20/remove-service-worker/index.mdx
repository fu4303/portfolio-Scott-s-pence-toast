title: Remove Service Gatsby Worker

The Gatsby offline plugin is really handy right up until you don't
want it anymore!

How I got round it was taking the `sw.js` file from the
`gatsby-plugin-remove-service-worker` plugin and added that to the
build script of my new site.

Then when the new site spins up it will remove the old service worker.

```js
self.addEventListener('install', function (e) {
  self.skipWaiting()
})

self.addEventListener('activate', function (e) {
  self.registration
    .unregister()
    .then(function () {
      return self.clients.matchAll()
    })
    .then(function (clients) {
      clients.forEach(client => client.navigate(client.url))
    })
})
```
