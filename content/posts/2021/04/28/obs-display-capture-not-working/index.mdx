I came across this issue today when trying to set up OBS on a new
machine where trying to add a display capture and there was no output
for the screen.

I found a fix, apparently this only affects laptops and it's to do
with the video card.

There's a section buried in the settings to add custom options for
apps located:

```text
Settings > System > Display > Graphics settings > Custom options for apps
```

in there is an option to 'Add an app', select 'Desktop app' then
navigate to OBS mine is located here:

```text
C:\Program Files\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe
```

OBS is now added to the all apps list, if I click on it I get two
buttons 'Options' and 'Remove'. Clicking the options I'm asked for
Graphics preference with 'Let Windows decide' as the default.

Selecting the 'Power saving' option didn't do anything for me so I
enabled 'High performance' going back to OBS and closing and opening
it again (classic) I could then see the display capture.

This partly worked but I spent the next four hours trying to work out
why my Twitch chat and alerts weren't showing I found another solution
in this video where I had to disable on of the graphics cards.
