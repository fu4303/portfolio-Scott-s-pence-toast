I came across this issue today when trying to set up OBS on a new
machine where trying to add a display capture and there was no output
for the screen.

I found a fix, apparently this only affects laptops and it's to do
with the video card.

This partly worked but I spent the next four hours trying to work out
why my Twitch chat and alerts weren't showing I found another solution
in this video where I had to disable on of the graphics cards.
