I was listening to James Q Quick on his podcast, he was doing his
origin story and there were some questions being asked and someone
asked this question which got me thinking.

> Did you ever consider giving up?

(This is coming from my privileged background)

The thought never occurred to me.

Sure I've had terrible times at work, but I never thought "You know
what, I'm going to farm carrots instead"

It's strange, because I wasn't in a great spot when I started web
development in late 2016.

I had just parted ways with my last (VBA) client and I was at a
crossing point, I knew the market I was in and the skills I had where
limited.

I could still be doing what I was doing for a decade (from 2006
to 2016) in automating Excel spreadsheets for large financial
organisations.
