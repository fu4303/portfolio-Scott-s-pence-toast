title: Full Screen Resolution With No Guest Additions in VirtualBox

Virtual Box Guest Additions _can_ be a bit of a pain to set up
sometimes.

My current PC setup for some reason wouldn't show a VM in the full
resolution.

I went through a lot of post followed loads of instructions with none
of them working until I watched this video from ArcoLinux.

There's a couple of options I've never had to configure before but
once I did I got a full screen resolution without having to mess
around with installing Guest Additions.

First up is "Enable PAE/NX" then I also checked "Enable Nested
VT-x/AMD-V"

![system extended features]

Then the display setting pick the "VBoxSVGA" option from the "Graphics
Controller" dropdown.

![display screen setting]

With these setting enabled ther's no need to install the Guest
Additions software.

> I've found that I need only to enable "Enable Nested VT-x/AMD-V"

After reading this post on [SuperUser] and the accompanying [WikiPedia
page] I decided to disable the "Enable PAE/NX" setting and play around
with the settings a bit more and I've found that I need only to enable
"Enable Nested VT-x/AMD-V"

On Windows and macOS you may need to enable the options through the
CLI, instructions on that can be found in this video.
